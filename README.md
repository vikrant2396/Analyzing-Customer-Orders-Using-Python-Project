Analyzing Customer Orders Using Python – Professional Project Description

In this project, I designed and implemented a complete customer order analysis system using Python to help an e-commerce business understand customer purchasing behavior and optimize product strategies. The project involved organizing and processing order data using Python data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. 

I analyzed customer transactions to classify buyers into high-value, moderate, and low-value segments based on their total spending. I also categorized products, identified the most profitable product categories, extracted frequently purchased items, and calculated category-wise revenue contributions. 

Using loops, conditionals, and set operations, I uncovered key insights such as top customers, cross-category purchase patterns, and popular product segments. This project demonstrates my ability to translate raw order data into meaningful business insights, showcasing strong skills in Python programming, data analysis, 
problem-solving, and real-world decision-making—key capabilities for roles in data analytics, business intelligence, and e-commerce analysis.
